I also need to refocus my skillset because I feal I dug myself into a hole by majoring in petroleum engineering. Thanks to the collapse in oil price, there haven't been many open positions for us...

I kinda thought ahead and did grad apps and got into GA tech for masters in mechanical (I applied without thesis but now I extremely regret this and am trying to get a thesis advisor) but I couldn't find any GRA's or GTA's to waive my oos tuition... so this will be a super expensive ($30k+) wager that this MSME will dramatically expand my job opportunities while avoiding a gap time in my resume. I wanted to do MSME because I thought it would posit me into the growing fields of robotics and automation (I wanted to focus on mechatronics and controls). GA tech is top 5 in mechanical but I dont know if thats worth 30k...

On the other hand I can also do another semester at UT like a post bacc i guess. I was planning on credit by examing CS 303E before semester starts, and then finish out the rest of the elements of computing certificate (cs 313e, security and databases all just need 303e as pre req btw) fall as well as a mech e mechatronics class. I was planning on teaching myself more while doing these classes though moocs. Tuition will be $5k. While it will give me time to do more job apps, idk how much marketable/skills gained these classes will give either. but hey the world cant have enough coding skills apparently

I was also considering just doing a coding bootcamp. will set me back 10k. but i have read a lot of negative feedback about them and dont even know if I would learn more than if i did the elements certificate. 

My default course was to just do the msme or atleast procrastinate the decision more till i hopefully secure a GRA and funding. But any and all advice very well welcomed!!!

Great for scoring some quick, cheap meals. I thought I'd list out the ones I know and what the discounts are. For most of these you can easily search for referral links, and I won't post mine here since that's not really good reddiquette, but I'd be happy to share the links if anyone messages me who wants them.

If you know of any others, add it in the comments!

Caviar - delivery from local restaurants.
$10 off

Delivery.com - delivery from local restaurants.
$7 off (also, you can get $5 off a separate order by using Visa Checkout, but it can't be combined with the referral discount, as far as I can tell)

DoorDash - delivery from local restaurants.
$7 off (possibly off delivery fees only)

Postmates - delivery from lots of types of stores.
$10 off (definitely off delivery fees only)

Graze - curated snacks sent to your door.
First box free as well as fifth box free (you can cancel after the first free box if you want). I've used this for a while and actually really like their snacks.

UberEATS - delivery from local restaurants.
$10 off

Instacart - 
Fast grocery delivery. Free delivery and $10 off your first order. Works with Publix, Whole Foods, and Kroger.

I'm a second year and I just switched out of ChemE to pure chem because this is what I really like. I am okay with going to grad school, but I'm not really sure if this is what I REALLY want. Next semester, I can switch to CS (I like coding too but I don't know if I want to be a full-time programmer). I know CS jobs now days are high demanding and has a lot of vision.

I'm like almost half way through the chem classes, and I can probably graduate in three semesters (i.e. IF I don't do internships/co-op/study abroad). If I switch my major again, I probably will have to take summers to graduate in 4 years, and it means I will incur more debt, and probably won't have the time to take off for a study abroad or an internship.  

Suggestions? Thanks. ",false,4zfrta,,0,,false,1473077368,false,self,t5_2r8t2,false,,,false,true,,/r/gatech/comments/4zfrta/lost_in_life_cant_settle_on_a_major/,t3_4zfrta,,false,,

So initially, I planned to take 16 credit hours for my first semester including Math 1552, Engl 1102, Phys 2211, CS 1301 and APPH 1040.

Then during FASET I heard some sincere advice from advisors and upperclassmen to not overload yourself and to avoid lab science, especially physics, during your first semester.
So later I trimmed down my schedule to 14 hours- Math 1552, Engl 1102, CS 1301, and BIO 1501. I couldn't fit in APPH 1040 or CS 1101 due to time conflicts.

Is my latter schedule to easy? Should I stick to my original plan or add some more credit hours to my new schedule?
I am a potential CM major and am thinking and preparing myself to switching major later on.

Thank you!

So here is a slightly complex question, 

I have a friend who I am helping to transfer over to GT for liberal arts. As you know, GT requires a lab science elective for liberal arts students. 

According to GT:

Lab science electives indicate that students have some flexibility in choosing which science courses to complete for admission consideration. All lab science courses must include both lecture and lab components. 
For majors without specifically required subjects, these requirements can be met with biology, chemistry, earth and atmospheric sciences, or calculus-based physics courses. 

So my friend is taking GEOL 101L at GPC (now GSU) most likely. This course is basically Geology with Lab. He plans on taking the lab sequence for it. 

Georgia Tech awards ""SCI 1XXX - Science Elective (4 credit hours)"" for each course (Geol 1 and Geol 2), according to the transfer equivalence website. 

However, this course is not equivalent to Biology, Chem, Physics, or Earth and Atmospheric Science at GT, and like stated above, GT says:

""For majors without specifically required subjects, these requirements can be met with biology, chemistry, earth and atmospheric sciences, or calculus-based physics courses. ""

So now I'm confused. Will they take this course as a required science elective for transferring?

I would call admissions directly, but they're obviously closed for the weekend. I am turning to GT Reddit for help since people here seem to know GT inside and out.  This all came up last minute, and school starts Monday. . . . 

My friend is pretty busy a lot of the time with work and is a close friend of mine, so I'm doing this to help him out a bit. 

Thanks for all of your time and help guys!

I recently met a guy from Mississippi State and we're both ME majors, so I started asking him about some of the classes he just finished. To my surprise, plenty of the classes he is required to take aren't at all required for me. Thermo II, Calc IV, and Physics III are just a few that are required for students at Mississippi State, but not here for this major. I know that students can take these classes here at their leisure, but I would like to know why exactly does our curriculum lack in depth as it seems to this school. I would imagine that the base of knowledge after ""diving deeper"" into ME would be much more valuable after graduation. Any thoughts?

Little did I know that with a degree in one of the sciences (Bio, Chem, Physics, etc.), your job prospects are pretty limited to teaching or being a lab tech, so I switched to engineering so that I could do the math and science I love but have decent job prospects. The problem with this is that UGA's engineering program is nothing compared to Tech's and now I feel like I made the absolute wrong choice. What sorts of things should I be doing to boost my transfer application?

So I applied to GT this past applications cycle, and I didn't get in for Freshman Admissions. However, I was offered a Conditional Acceptance offer for Fall 2017. My goal is to transfer into the School of Liberal Arts. 

The requirements for the Conditional Offer for liberal arts are seemingly simple, two semesters of English, CALC 1 and CALC 2 sequence, and 30 total credit hours. The required GPA is minimal (I think a 3.3 or something).

I am confident that I can fulfil all the required courses, except for Mathematics. 

In HS, I did not take PreCalculus. Instead, I took a course called IB Math Studies SL, which touches on trigonometry and statistics, as well as differential calculus, but doesn't really go into the more complicated parts of trig and precalc. 

For that reason, I will be starting of at Precalculus in College. Yet, I have to complete the GT required math sequence by June 1st. GT Admissions is not willing to allow me to take Calculus 2 in the summer or even during a Maymester somewhere. 

GT also has an alternative math sequence, which is GT MATH 1711 and 1712 (Finite Math + Survey of Calc). However, it is rare to find an institution that offers a transferable MATH 1711 (being a more GT specific course)

I need to find some way to work this out somehow. Basically, how can I complete Precalc, calc 1, and calc 2 by June 1st. 

I had an opportunity to take Calculus 1 online (without math placement), but GT was unwilling to accept that course for course credit (many other schools do though). My university was willing to take that course, which I would have taken and then taken Calculus 2 at my current university (which is transferable to GT). However, GT wants me to take Calc 1 and Calc 2, they won't just let me take Calculus 2. 

I know GT doesn't have the best liberal arts school, but for personal reasons, I need to stay close to home (I live in Atlanta). I like the campus feeling of GT as well which is another reason I want to transfer. 

My conditional offer lasts only one year. Do you guys have any suggestions?

Thanks for your help in advance. ",false,4y7lae,,0,,false,1473054923,false,self,t5_2r8t2,false,,,false,true,,/r/gatech/comments/4y7lae/georgia_tech_conditional_admission_fall_2017/,t3_4y7lae,,false,,

We are in need of 2 or 3 other individuals who might be interested in helping us develop the prototype. The program counts as a 3 hour class under the title of undergraduate research toward any of the majors at Tech. It can be a great project to put on a resume. It doesn't really matter what year you are as long as you are interested in the project and willing to meet and work together. It should have a similar workload to any other 3 credit hour class, but it will be all student run, besides a short weekly meeting with our mentor. 

Link to the I2P program page: http://i2p.gatech.edu/

About the Project: 
The goal is to prototype a motorized rechargeable bicycle to be used as a convenient for of travel for urban professionals, students, etc. We will be trying to minimize the environmental impact of the bike as well by attempting to have the bike charge via renewable energy sources, i.e. solar. We are still in the early stages of the design process. 

If you are interested please message me here and we can discuss it.

I'm a rising 2nd year, and my current major is chemical engineering. I didn't find the first chemical engineering class very interesting at all, and I can't really see myself continue and be successful. I, however, do like pure chemistry, especially organic chemistry. I loved both orgo classes and even Synthesis Lab I, and I certainly do want to learn more in depth. 

I thought that I was sure about being a chemistry major and going to graduate school. I thought about it a lot (constantly for weeks and months), but I'm not even sure if this is what I really want. On one hand, I do want to research, which I can see myself doing. On the other hand, I want to be earning a decent amount of money, pay off my debts, and enjoy my twenties not being in school.

Later, maybe I'll find out that I don't want to graduate school at all? What happens then? I probably would be stuck with a $30k job and barely be able to support myself. I can switch to CS or something because I do like coding too (not as much as chem though), and I'll probably be better off, but I'll waste three semesters worth of chem classes. I also thought about BME, but I'm not quite sure where this will take me? 

I apologize for the lengthy message, but any advice from any one of you would be helpful. I'm sure a lot of you were on the same boat as me at one point. If any alumni/grad school students have thoughts to share too, I would appreciate it very much! Thanks!!

Between having a 3.81GPA, being involved in multiple service clubs and honors societies in the past 3 years, working through college, taking a large course load fall 2015 and fall 2016 (had to medically withdraw Spring 2016), and having dealt with a lot of challenges including mental and physical (fractured a rib in a hazing incident while at University of Alabama which led to my decision to medically withdraw and then transfer to Kennesaw State) I feel that my essays and my resume would make me a competitive transfer applicant. 

HOWEVER, I am hearing that ALL course requirements must be met to even be considered? This previously was not a concern for me, but I recently realized that my major (Economics and International Affairs) requires a second Lab Science Elective but does not require Computer Science (one of my current classes). At this point it's too late to change my schedule at KSU so I am stuck in Computer Science and am left wondering whether or not my application will even be considered at this point. I feel that I am definitely a competitive applicant having read through the other transfer topics, but I am very concerned this one mistake is going to make me stay another semester at KSU despite what I believe (and have been told by my friends at Tech) to be a strong resume. Any thoughts on my situation? Will taking Computer Science instead of another Lab Science Elective (whatever that entails anyway) mean that I don't even have a chance this semester? Any insight will be greatly appreciated and go jackets!

We're the Wreck Techs, and we're your *free* housing technology support resource (who also fix the internet). We're here to help you get your devices connected to the GT networks - whether it's a laptop, desktop, router, game console, streaming device, or most anything else - Even smart lightbulbs! We're also providing tech support for computer problems such as virus infections, software installations, and OS problems. We're here to provide ""fanatical support"" to residents of campus housing.

**Office Locations and Hours**

*Brittain Lounge* (Behind Brittain Dining, near Laundry Room)

*Curran Garage* (Near WingZone)

Both offices are open 9am-9pm Thursday-Saturday and 9am-10pm Sunday. We'll be responding to phone calls, help requests (from our [website](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu)), emails (support -at- wrecktechs.gatech.edu), and walk-in visits, in addition to our freshman residence hall walkthroughs.

**Fall Semester Hours**

*Walk-In Support*: Sunday-Thursday 2pm-10pm, Friday 2pm-6pm

*Phone/Email/Chat Support*: Sunday 2pm-10pm, Monday-Thursday 11am-10pm, Friday 11am-6pm

**Residence Hall Walkthroughs**

We'll be making rounds in every Freshman residence hall twice each day on Thursday and Saturday. Our staff members will be knocking on everyone's doors offering assistance with getting devices connected to the network, and with any other technology-related issues you may be facing. You can check and see when we'll be coming by on [our website](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/room-assistance).

**How do I connect my device?**

We have instructions for connecting the most popular devices on our website. 

- [Game Consoles](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/game-consoles)  
- [Apple TV](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/apple-tv)  
- [Chromecast](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/chromecast)

- [Laptop/Desktop (Wireless)](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/gtwifi)

These are just some of the useful guides from our [website](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu). You can find all of this and more in just a few clicks.

**GTother Device Registrations**

If you have a device like a Chromecast, Fire TV Stick, Raspberry Pi, or something else that can't connect to GTwifi, we can register it for you on GTother for a four-month registration. This works around having to sign the device into LAWN every time you want to use it. If you want to take advantage of this, submit a [help request](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/help-request) (select category ""Wireless Network"" and summary ""Device Registration"". Please include the type of device that you want registered, and one of our staff members will get back to you as soon as possible with what we need from you to get it registered.

Note that our procedure has changed slightly from the last year or so for those of you that have been around. We're not requiring you to come into our office to register devices any more (except in extenuating circumstances). We have a new procedure that's more convenient for both you guys and us. Hooray process improvement! If you're nearby though and want to stop by to get it registered, you are more than welcome to do so.

**Reminder about Wireless Routers**

Please keep in mind that if you opt to use a router in your dorm to connect multiple devices, any wireless radios *must be disabled* per the Georgia Tech CNUSP. We will be aggressively checking for broadcasting networks during Fall Move In, so please ensure that you have any wireless features disabled. If you're not sure how to do this, feel free to flag one of us down during our walkthroughs or submit a [help request](http://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/help-request) and we'd be happy to help you out.

I'm a rising second year at tech, and I've completed my freshman year as a CMPE major. I love coding and all things computer science related, but also was interested in computer hardware so I went with CMPE to start with. Recently, I built two mechanical keyboards myself, including minor coding and a lot of soldering. 

This summer I've been working a Co-op as a mobile developer, and I'm enjoying coding much more than I previously thought I would. (I like coding in general, non-specific to mobile. It's just the job I got!) So much so that I'm curious as to just how much CS I can fill my CMPE major with. I don't want to take many EE related courses, but I don't know how realistic it is to fill as many electives as I can with CS related courses. 

I took Math 1554 in preparation in case I wanted to switch, so I don't need to retake it. But this up coming semester is a lot of CMPE courses and few CS courses, so I wanted to seriously consider what I'm going to do before the semester starts. If any of you have had experience with being CMPE who wants to take a lot of CS courses, how was getting classes for you? Would a CS Minor benefit me or should I switch to CS with a hardware thread? Basically just trying to get a pro/con of my choices!

At the year 2 competition, the GT team was one of a few teams to get our car running! However, there is still plenty of work to do in Year 3 and we have open spots on our team. Over the next 10 months we will finish integrating vehicle components, refining our controls strategy, expanding work on a computer vision based ADAS, and much more. There is also a separate part of the competition aimed at educating the public about hybrid vehicles, managing social media, finding sponsors, and giving presentations to industry sponsors. At Georgia Tech, EcoCAR 3 is part of the Vertically Integrated Projects program; this means that team members actually get 1 or 2 class credits for their work. 


In order to continue our success into year 3, we are trying to fill roles in the following sub teams:

* **Electrical (ECE majors):** Responsible for all of the LV and HV wiring in the vehicle. In year 3, team members will be integrating our electric motor and wiring our energy storage system.
  
* **Modeling, Simulation and Controls (ECE, CS, and ME’s with interest in controls):** Responsible for developing and maintaining vehicle models in Simulink, developing test plans for controls code, writing controls code in Stateflow, and using dSPACE to perform Hardware-In-The-Loop testing.

* **Innovation and ADAS (CS and ECE):** Responsible for programming the NXP S32V processing board to recognize different aspects of the driving environment such as traffic signs or children playing the street. Responsible for developing code that for our Innovation Topic of Predictive Powertrain Control. Using information from the ADAS and the GPS data, we can predict different properties about the road and thus choose a more effective charging strategy to significantly increase MPG.

* **Project Management, Development, Communications (CM, BA, IE):** Responsible for maintaining the scope, schedule, and budget of the team, finding sponsorships, managing social media accounts, helping engineering teams develop presentations and reports, planning outreach events, etc.   


If the work sounds cool, but you are still unsure, here are some reasons (other than working on a Camaro with an awesome group of people) you should join the team:

1. Your experiences on the team will make you *EXTREMELY* desirable to employers. You will experience every step of the design process, gain problem solving skills and work with people of different majors. When you go to an interview, companies only want to hear about what you do with EcoCAR 3 and you will have more than enough to talk about.
2. We are sponsored by big companies like GM, Bosch, Mathworks, NXP, dSPACE, Siemens, etc. These companies specifically recruit EcoCAR 3 students. Plus, they provide us with top of the line software and hardware that you don’t normally learn in a classroom or at an internship.
3. You may have the opportunity to travel. We have multiple workshops/competition events a year, and they are throughout the country in places like Boston, Austin, Detroit, and Washington DC. 



**If you are interested in joining the team, you can apply here: http://tinyurl.com/ecocarsignup**


If you want to know more about the project, we will be having an **info session** on *Tuesday August 23rd 11am-12pm in Van Leer 457* and we will be at the VIP poster session later that day *4pm-5pm in the Klaus Atrium*. If you have questions, feel free to send me a message!

I'm in the process of getting my 1302C credit transferred, but I have little faith that I will get it for CS 1331 since it's in C#, so that's why this test will most likely be necessary.

As someone who spent many years drinking in Dublin and watching hapless American students flounder before the Notre Dame - Navy game a few years back, I figured I'd put together a short guide on drinking in Dublin.  I'll start with a few pointers on alcohol and pub etiquette, and follow this up with a bunch of recommendations.

&amp;nbsp;

**What to drink**

You'll be in Ireland, so you'd want to be drinking Guinness or Irish Whiskey.  Some of you may realize that Irish cream (Baileys) is also Irish.  But that's oversimplofying things.  Here are a few more detailed recommendations:

* *Guinness*.  A beer of the stout family.  It's huge in Dublin, to the point that you'd hardly find its two main competitors - Beamish and Murphy's - here.  Locals will tell you that Guinness tastes differently from pub to pub, and will recommend where to go.  For starters, nearly all Guinness tastes better in Dublin than in the US, but later I'll mention some of the better pubs.  Some craft breweries also sell their own porters.  Most notable among them are Plain Porter from the Porterhouse chain and Stormy Port from Galway Bay Brewery.
* *Irish ales*.  Not to be confused with India Ales, even though many places list both as IPA or red ale, depending on the beer.  I personally find them lacking a distinct taste, far from the hoppiness of real IPAs.  The most favorite among here is Smithwicks.  Too close to water, in my opinion, but some people like to have one as the last beer of the night.
* *Lager beers*.  Heineken and Carlsberg are so popular around here that breweries started making their own lagers.  The most common ones in Dublin, ranked by my personal preference, are Clonmel, Five Lamps and Hop House 13.
* *Cider*.  Ireland is huge on apple cider.  If the weather is nice (the first weekend in September is typically very unpredictable), people will drink it will ice.  The dominant brand is Bulmers, but you can also get sweeter ciders Kopaberg (not on tap, as far as I can tell), and Orchand Thieves.
* *Wine*.  Wine is horrendously bad in Ireland.  The main reason for this is immense import and excise taxes on wine, which reach 7.50 Euros for the cheapest bottle (sale price 10 Euros).  Don't drink wine here.
* *Spirits*.  Whiskey is abundant here, but fairly expensive.  People here don't drink shots - they either mix spirits (Jack and Coke, Vodka Red Bull), or drink it on rocks.  A typical shot size is about half of what I remember in Atlanta and elsewhere, at higher price.
* *Hot alcohol*.  Irish coffee is available, but I recommend it only in very specialized locations, such as good hotels or whiskey-related tourist establishments (Jameson distillery actually has one of the best in town).  Far more common is hot whiskey, which is basically a shot of whiskey, hot water, lemon and cloves.  Great for warming up if the weather turns nasty.

&amp;nbsp;

**How to drink Guinness**

Let's face it: you'll come over for the Guinness, and most likely you'll get shitfaced.  However, despite having only marginally more calories than Bud Light and less alcohol content than your average lager, it can do weird things to your digestive tract.  When Notre Dame played Navy here, I've seen lots of Americans throwing up even before they left the pub.  You simply don't drink Guinness fast.  You sip it and have a nice conversation, and before you know if you've downed six of them.  I personally average a pint of Guinness per hour for a good time, and if I want to last through the night I alternate it with Coke.

If you're not used to drinking copious amounts of Guinness, don't start doing so in Dublin.  If you do, the next morning you'll be experiencing something known here as Guinness farts (best case) or Guinness shits (worst case).  Some biochemists may correct me here, but given the particular smell I assume both are caused in part by the beer having nitrogen bubbles, not CO2.  If you want to see a portion of the city or the game, please, don't overdo it the evening before with Guinness.  You may get a headache from other drinks, but at least you won't spend the day in the crapper.  (Fun fact: crapper is actually named after Thomas Crapper &amp; Co, a nearly 150 years old British manufacturer of, well, crappers.)

&amp;nbsp;

**What not to do in the pub**

From what I remember from the US and what I learned in Ireland, you absolutely should not order the following two drinks:

* *Irish Car Bomb* - The name says it all.  It's simply offensive.  What's even more offensive, though, is dumping Baileys into a perfectly good pint of Guinness.
* *Black &amp; Tan* - First of all, they won't serve it here anyway.  But more importantly, Black &amp; Tans were a British-backed terror group during Irish was for independence.  They committed such attrocities that to this day ""Black and tan"" or ""Tan"" are used as a curse words.

&amp;nbsp;

**A word on money**

We use money to pay for items here.  Just like the US, with the slight difference that our 1 and 2 Euros are in coins and if you're not careful, you'll soon have your pocket ripped apart by the sheer weight of those coins.  Oh, and we include sales tax into the final price, so what you see on the product is what you'll actually pay.  Here are a few pointers you'd better be aware of:

* Chip and pin is the king.  In Ireland (and elsewhere in Europe), you'll never lose sight of your card.  When you pay in a restaurant or a bar, you'll hold your card until the waitress/barman bring a card reader, you'll insert the card in and give your pin, and you'll take it out.  This means that leaving your card with the bartender for the evening is not done.  If a bartender offers it, he's most likely a scumbag out to rob you.
* Swipe and sign is not available everywhere.  Forget swiping your cards and signing your bill in pubs.  This payment method may be available in your hotel and tourist shops, but even when they have the technology, staff may not be trained to deal with it.  A few years back I witnessed a scene where a bunch of American tourists tried to swipe their card at a McDonald's, and their PIN didn't work.  The staff didn't know how to handle the situation, and they left elsewhere.
* Swipe and PIN may not work.  I visited Atlanta in April, and most payment terminals (including those at the GT bookstore) didn't accept chip cards.  When I swiped my card, my PIN wouldn't work.  I was told that when swiping my card, the PIN would have to be authorized by my bank, and that wouldn't work overseas.  Maybe US banks have better systems in place, but I wouldn't count on it.
* Cash.  Cash is the most reliable way to pay around here, but Dublin, especially the tourist areas, has a high density of pickpockets.  If possible, don't carry all that much cash on you, preferably in multiple pockets or in socks.
* Tipping.  One last thing about money management here: people are not used to the level of tips that are common in the US.  Generally, you don't tip the cab driver or bartender, or just very little to round up to the next full Euro, if you don't want too much change in your pockets.  Occasionally, cab drivers round down the fare; I then give them the extra Euro, as if rounded up.  I generally don't leave more than 20 cents to the bartenders - they don't expect it, and often the coins sit there until another bar patron grabs them.  In restaurants, a few extra Euros are permissible, but usually not more than 10% (for exceptional service).

&amp;nbsp;

**A few safety pointers**

Finally, a word or two on safety.  Dublin has improved tremendously over the past decade or so.  It's become much more cosmopolitan, and the center is gentrified.  Still, tourists and especially drunk tourists are often victims of crimes.  You rarely get firearms involved; it's mainly fists and occasionally sticks or knives (carrying a blade longer than about 2"" is illegal).  Especially areas in and around Temple Bar, Dame Lane and Harcourt Street have a high degree of physical assaults.  The attackers are usually bands of feral teenagers who can be quite vicious.  Recently, a 17 years old girl was in court for kicking an unconscious tourist (he's been beaten down by her friends before) fifteen times, until his skull caved in.  She already had 26 previous convictions.  This is the kind of people who will attack you if you end up alone and drunk, so keep in a group and don't let yourself be provoked.

In addition to physical attacks, be aware of the bouncers in the city.  They are the ultimate rulers of the pub and club scene, and they don't seem accountable even to the venue owners.  Even though I've never had problems with them, I've heard from others and read reports about them being racist and very capricious as to who they let in.  Once you are in a club, though, good luck getting help from them in case of trouble.  The number one complaint for clubs on Tripadvisor is the behavior of the boucers.

&amp;nbsp;

**Pub and club recommendations**

Here we are, to the fun part of my article: where to have a good time.  I created a few thematic areas, each with a map of the establishments I mentioned.  Note that this is based on my personal experience and the experience of my friends, so it's inherently subjective.

&amp;nbsp;

[The drunk tourist route](https://i.sli.mg/O3NhKr.png)

To my great dismay, you'll most likely end up drinking here.  Every tourist with limited time goes to these places, and while they are still better than any faux Irish place you get elsewhere in the world, they offer a very limited experience.  This route takes place in and arount Temple Bar, the best known pub district in the world.  Until recently, Apple Maps placed the Dublin ZOO over Temple Bar, and I have a nagging suspicion that they did it on purpose: you have a bar upon bar here, with drinking spilling outside.  Walk through the area at 5 in the morning, and you'll still get the odd toruist puking on the corner and cleanup crews sweeping all the broken glass.  When Notre Dame was planying Navy here, this area was choke full of first-time drinkers, so you can imagine the mess.  In this area, I'd like to point out the following fine establishments:

1. [The Temple Bar](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'43.7%22N+6%C2%B015'51.3%22W/@53.3454642,-6.2664497,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.345461!4d-6.264261) - the cornerstone of the Dublin pub scene.  It's been through a recent expansion, now features its own gift shop and most recently a beer garden.  Every self-respecting tourist should have a pint here.  In fact, Georgia Tech will have its tailgate party here on Sep 2, from 7.30.
2. [Porterhouse](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'42.2%22N+6%C2%B016'02.6%22W/@53.3450542,-6.2695827,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.345051!4d-6.267394) - a largely vertical pub for the discerning crowd.  Brews its own beer, does not tolerate rowdy or overly drunk behavior, and thanks to being a little on the side, is generally a little more quiet.
3. [Czech Inn](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'42.0%22N+6%C2%B016'04.1%22W/@53.3449902,-6.2699907,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.344987!4d-6.267802) - On the periphery of Temple Bar.  Not really a Guinness pub, but it's quite appealing to young international crowd for drinking and dancing.
4. [The Palace Bar](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'45.3%22N+6%C2%B015'34.5%22W/@53.3459122,-6.2617827,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.345909!4d-6.259594) - On the other side of Temple Bar.  Surpricingly good Guinness, and largely local clientelle.
5. [The Mercantile](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'38.5%22N+6%C2%B015'50.5%22W/@53.3440352,-6.2662247,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.344032!4d-6.264036) - A very large pub, very popular with tourists.  People often spill behind the pub onto Dame Lane, where they can hop into Stag's Head (more traditional pub), 4 Dame Lane (downstairs pub, upstairs dance floor), and Dame Tavern.  The three-way intersection between these pubs can get quite packed with pub patrons.  Be aware, though, that The Mercantile has a reputation among my friends for very racist bouncers.
6. [The Workman's Club](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'43.5%22N+6%C2%B015'59.5%22W/@53.3454182,-6.2687027,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.345415!4d-6.266514) - Very popular late night club right at the river.  I've personally never been there, but my friends who live in the area speak highly of it.

There are lots of other pubs for drinking or eating, as well as finer establishments (Vintage Cocktail Club, The Liquor Rooms) and restaurants (go to Zaytoons for your drunk kebab), but listing them all would make this post unbearably long.

&amp;nbsp;

[The good Guinness pub crawl](https://i.sli.mg/yNOvPw.png)

If you truly want good Guinness, here's a route I would recommend:

1. [Hogan's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'31.3%22N+6%C2%B015'52.5%22W/@53.3420362,-6.2667717,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.342033!4d-6.264583).  Short distance from The Temple Bar, and a traditional Irish pub with plenty of space inside and a little outside.  The Guinness is fairly good, and it costs 4.95.  I used to put the five-cent coins I got back into a separate pocket, so that I could count how many pints I had once I sobered up.
2. [The Long Hall](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'30.5%22N+6%C2%B015'55.0%22W/@53.3417992,-6.2674797,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.341796!4d-6.265291).  Across the street from Hogans, and in my opinion, it used to have the best Guinness in town.  Haven't been there for two years, though, so that may have changed.  Be aware that they are not all that fond of large crowds and may not serve you or will ask you to leave if you are too loud or drunk.
3. [Grogans](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'32.0%22N+6%C2%B015'45.4%22W/@53.3422352,-6.2647977,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.342232!4d-6.262609).  A short way from Hogans.  The pub is very small inside, so people usually stand around outside, in a pedestrianized zone.
4. [Kehoes](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'28.2%22N+6%C2%B015'33.9%22W/@53.3411643,-6.2609566,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.341162!4d-6.259409).  A very typical city pub, with multiple floors, carpets and fireplaces.  Great Guinness and great atmosphere, especially on Fridays after work.
5. [O'Donoghue's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'17.6%22N+6%C2%B015'15.2%22W/@53.3382242,-6.2564187,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.338221!4d-6.25423).  One of the best known pubs in town.  It has two sections and a ""beer garden"" standing area inbetween.  The pub is famous as the birthplace of The Dubliners, and till this day people come here to play or sing.  Their Guinness is one of the best.
6. [Mulligans](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'48.8%22N+6%C2%B015'19.8%22W/@53.3468782,-6.2576847,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.346875!4d-6.255496).  Many people say it has the best Guinness in town.  This pub has a local feel to it, with most patrons being from the neighborhood.  It's a little out of the way, though, so I haven't been there in a while.

&amp;nbsp;

[Let's go clubbing](https://sli.mg/GKTJhZ.png)

If you are into clubbing, your best bet is Harcourt Street, but there are other places as well.  Please note that some clubs may have higher age limit, up to 26.  Most clubs charge around 10 Euros after 11PM.

1. [Dicey's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'09.0%22N+6%C2%B015'48.7%22W/@53.3358282,-6.2657097,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.335825!4d-6.263521).  Dublin's top destination for late afternoon/early evening clubbing and very cheap beer.  This place is frequented primarily by foreign students, especially Brazilians.
2. [DTwo](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'03.7%22N+6%C2%B015'46.2%22W/@53.3343542,-6.2650337,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.334351!4d-6.262845).  I used to go here a lot in the past.  It has a large back garden for smokers, a dance floor on the street level (70s and 80s disco is quite popular there), and a dance floor underground.  Be aware that the security here is rubbish, with drunk guys groping women with impunity and coats and jackets disappearing regularly.
3. [Coppers](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'06.8%22N+6%C2%B015'48.5%22W/@53.3352252,-6.2656457,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.335222!4d-6.263457).  Full name is Copper Face Jacks.  This is an enormous club, well known in Dublin, and for many (including me) a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  It used to be notorious for one-night hookups.  Even though that has died down a little, this is still where single people go to find temporary love.  Despite its size, it gets really crowded in the middle of the night, so if you are with a group, expect to leave alone or leave some people behind.  In the past, the crowd used to consist mainly of Irish from outside Dublin, who commuted here for weekly shifts, primarily cops and nurses.
4. [The House](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'02.7%22N+6%C2%B015'18.2%22W/@53.3340912,-6.2572557,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.334088!4d-6.255067).  A more upscale club, for those who still like dancing or socializing but prefer a more civilized venue.  Enforces a dress code, so no sneakers please.
5. [Howl at the Moon](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'21.0%22N+6%C2%B014'43.9%22W/@53.3391722,-6.2477017,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.339169!4d-6.245513).  A popular place for students and all kinds of expats.  It has several floors with bars and a dance floor on the bottom.
6. [Cafe en Seine](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'26.4%22N+6%C2%B015'30.9%22W/@53.3406826,-6.2596853,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.340681!4d-6.258591).  A very popular place, with multiple bars, a dance floor and balconies surrounding the floor.  They also enforce a dress code, but it's worth coming here.  It also is one of the safest environments for dancing - everyone who comes here is a little more mature and little less intoxicated than elsewhere.
7. [Lillie's Bordello](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'34.8%22N+6%C2%B015'32.8%22W/@53.3430076,-6.2602053,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.343006!4d-6.259111) - If you ask me, it's a pretentious shithole popular with local politicians and celebrities.  But I may be just bitter that they charged 20 Euros instead of the usual 10, so I never went inside.  Lots of people told me they like the ambiance, though.

&amp;nbsp;

[For the discerning beer drinker](https://i.sli.mg/ROpBqD.png)

Recently, Ireland started giving tax credits for craft beer breweries, and the craft beer market exploded.  We already had quite a few brewpubs, but now the selection is really great.  Here are a few places you may want to try out if you want different beers:

1. Porterhouse ([1](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'42.2%22N+6%C2%B016'02.6%22W/@53.3450653,-6.2689316,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.345063!4d-6.267384) and [2](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'35.0%22N+6%C2%B015'32.3%22W/@53.3430542,-6.2611537,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.343051!4d-6.258965) on the map).  Has been around for a long time.  Brews its own beer and has an enormous selection of bottled beer.  Also serves food.  The one on Nassau Street (2 on map) also has multiple large screens for sports broadcasts.
2. Galway Bay Brewery has three pubs in town: [Alfie Byrne's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'05.2%22N+6%C2%B015'27.1%22W/@53.3347902,-6.2597157,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.334787!4d-6.257527) (3), [Against the Grain](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'13.4%22N+6%C2%B015'55.8%22W/@53.3370688,-6.2660502,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.337068!4d-6.265503) (4) and [The Beer Market](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'35.9%22N+6%C2%B016'24.0%22W/@53.3433121,-6.2741098,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.343311!4d-6.273336) (5).  Alfie Byrne's is now my home base.  It has 32 beers on tap and another 60 or so in bottles.  Unlike the other two, it is very large, ideal for large groups of people.
3. [The Black Sheep](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'59.2%22N+6%C2%B016'08.8%22W/@53.3497741,-6.2698728,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.349773!4d-6.269099) (6 on map).  One of the few places north of River Liffey that I like; has a large selection of beers.  The area is a little dodgy, so I don't go there too often, but I remember them having a large spinner you used when you couldn't decide what beer to get.
4. [P.Mac's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'28.3%22N+6%C2%B015'51.4%22W/@53.3411947,-6.2661245,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.341192!4d-6.264284) (7 on map).  A smallish place with lout metal music, but great beers.  Seems to have most Brewdog (a Scottish brewery) beers on tap, along with quite a few Belgian beers.
5. [Camden Exchange](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'05.6%22N+6%C2%B015'55.6%22W/@53.3348978,-6.2659942,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.334897!4d-6.265447) (8 on map).  Fewer beers to select from, compared to the others, but it has also an interesting selection, and it's the only place I know where I can reliably get a Brooklyn Lager.  Serves food as well.

&amp;nbsp;

[Other venues of interest](https://i.sli.mg/eexoyp.png)

A few others you may want to check out if you didn't die of alcohol poisoning yet.

1. [Whelan's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'11.7%22N+6%C2%B015'56.5%22W/@53.3365778,-6.2662462,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.336577!4d-6.265699).  Probably the best known pub with a music venue in town.  They have concerts nearly every week, and the place can get quite wild, in a good way.
2. [Flannery's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'09.9%22N+6%C2%B015'54.7%22W/@53.3360878,-6.2657442,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.336087!4d-6.265197).  Just across the street from Whelan's.  It starts out as a quiet pub at 8 in the evening, but by 11 you have a line of people trying to get in.  Frequented by people who think they are too good for Coppers but want just the same.
3. [Bruxelles](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'28.9%22N+6%C2%B015'39.2%22W/@53.3413648,-6.2614262,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.341364!4d-6.260879).  Very loud heavy metal pub.  But if you are into this kind of music, this is the best place to be.
4. [George's](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'37.5%22N+6%C2%B015'52.7%22W/@53.3437398,-6.2651762,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.343739!4d-6.264629).  Dublin's largest gay club.
5. [Sinnots](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'24.5%22N+6%C2%B015'41.7%22W/@53.340137,-6.2622287,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.340136!4d-6.261578).  Burgers, beer and large screens with sports.  During popular sports events, entry may get limited.
6. [Woolshed Baa and Grill](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B021'01.1%22N+6%C2%B016'02.5%22W/@53.3503021,-6.2680764,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.350301!4d-6.267346).  The city's best known sports bar, and the only place I can watch NHL or NCAAF.  It has multiple screens with different broadcasts and serves food.  Can get really crowded, but I've never seen security turning people away.
7. [Brazen Head](https://www.google.ie/maps/place/53%C2%B020'41.8%22N+6%C2%B016'34.8%22W/@53.344932,-6.2770008,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d53.344931!4d-6.276331). Calls itself Dublin's oldest pub.  Slightly off the beaten track, but with good food and nice ambiance.  I like to bring my tourist visitors here for a pint and Irish stew.

I'm a 4th year student pursuing degrees in multiple majors and have been quite successful academically (high gpa, great internships at some of the best companies). I also work out regularly and am in shape. However as my 4th year begins I can't help but feel a little sad as I have never managed to get a single date in GT (or before that too). Unfortunately my only chance of meeting women is by cold approaching cause all my degrees are in heavily male dominated areas. I thought maybe life out of GT would be better, however when I interned I realized that even the region where I work the ratio is completely skewed. I tried joining clubs (in fact leader of one) however there again the ratio is ridiculously skewed cause my area of interest is just no attractive to females either. As you can imagine my friend circle is 100% single guys... We don't really party/drink much either...

I have tried cold/direct approaching in the past like 3-4 times and been rejected every time. I tried tinder, and got like 2 responses in months of swiping but 0 dates...

What advice can you give regarding how to approach and when/where to approach... I would just like 1 date before I graduate as I feel very lonely and sad when I look and see so many pretty women on campus. Personal success stories would be highly appreciated!

P.S. I dunno if it matters but my race is Asian and we get stereotyped about this I think and I don't mind dating any race.",false,4ye8dw,,0,,false,1473058292,false,self,t5_2r8t2,false,,,false,true,,/r/gatech/comments/4ye8dw/best_way_to_colddirect_approach_girls_you_dont/,t3_4ye8dw,,false,,
